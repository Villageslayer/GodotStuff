# Contributing to Libre Pinball

## Translations

- It is recommended you edit the source CSV using a tool like LibreOffice Calc.
- Import the translation, and choose `locale/` as output directory. Double-check there are no modified files other than `engine.cfg` as well as the locale files themselves.
- Test your translation before sending it.
- Once you have finished your translation, make a pull request.
